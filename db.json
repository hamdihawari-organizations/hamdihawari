I collected some details with the help of the supervisor, Esra Rotthoff, as the details of my arduous journey from Damascus to Germany in 2015. Jasmine is a well-known Damascene symbol, and the red light accompanied me on my way across the border towards Germany. The rest of the details, such as money and coffee, are a group of details engraved in my mind, and they are completely Damascene details.",
